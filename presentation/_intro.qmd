## Agenda (1) {.smaller}

-   **Introduction**

-   **Objectives**

-   **Development of a framework for compiling NCTs.** The Extended Fisheries Global NCT (2022) as case study

    -   Background and starting point for the NCT
    -   Harmonising Food Composition Tables and Databases
    -   Visualisation for nutrient evaluation and missing values identification

## Agenda (2) {.smaller}

-   **The Extended Fisheries Global NCT (2022)**

    -   Food composition data for fishery products: Overview
    -   Visualisation for decision making (missing values and outliers)
    -   How scripted approach allow for fast update and re-use of the FCT for new purposes
    -   How collaborative coding and GitHub increases efficiency and transparency of the approach

-   **Conclusions & Recommendation for the future**

    -   What has been completed -- what needs to be further advanced?
    -   The need of better nutrition data for decision-making
    -   New data skills and statistical approach for better food and nutrition data.

-   **Q&A:** Discussion & Next Steps

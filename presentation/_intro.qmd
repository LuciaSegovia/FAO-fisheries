## Agenda (1) 

-   **Background**
<br/> 
-   **Objectives**
<br/> 
-   **Method: Development of a framework for compiling FCTs/NCTs** 
<br/> 
-   **Results: Reusable & transparent script for compiling compiling FCTs/NCTs** 


## Agenda (2) {.smaller} {visibility="hidden"}

-   **The Extended Fisheries Global NCT (2022)**

    -   Food composition data for fishery products: Overview
    -   Visualisation for decision making (missing values and outliers)
    -   How scripted approach allow for fast update and re-use of the FCT for new purposes
    -   How collaborative coding and GitHub increases efficiency and transparency of the approach

-   **Conclusions & Recommendation for the future**

    -   What has been completed -- what needs to be further advanced?
    -   The need of better nutrition data for decision-making
    -   New data skills and statistical approach for better food and nutrition data.

-   **Q&A:** Discussion & Next Steps

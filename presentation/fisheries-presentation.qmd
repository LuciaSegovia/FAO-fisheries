# Development of the framework for compiling NCTs

## Why the framework was needed?
<br/>

1. FCTs are available in multiple data formats.
2. Data harmonisation requires effort, expertise, and time.  
3. Increasing the standardisation of the FCTs would...

::: {.fragment}
\... Lower cost of updating & generating new NCTs.
:::
::: {.fragment}
\... Increase reproducibility of NCTs and their survey outputs.
:::
::: {.fragment}
\... Increase re-usability & dissemination of FCTs.

}")
   
                  
```

## Steps 1 & 2: Data Sources & Importing 

<br/> 

-  Downloading and storing original 11 FCTs [^2] + Norwegian FCT (2021).

-   FCTs were imported into R(Studio) & independent scripts were generated for each FCT.

- All the data operations (from Step 2 to Step 6) were done in R(Studio).

[^2]: FCTs and food components that were already identified & compiled in the Fisheries Global NCT.

::: notes
Thirteen FCTs were selected for the Food Global NCT, of which two were excluded, and one new was added for its relevance to the Fisheries Global NCT (i.e. to fill some data gaps for DHA and EPA).
:::

## Step 3: Data cleaning and standardisation of FCTs 

<br/> 

Food component names/ description standardisation using Tagnames[^3]. For example...<br/>

"Vitamin B12" -> VITB12 
<br/>

::: {.fragment}

"Vitamin A" -> VITA or VITA_RAE? <br/>
"Vitamin B6" -> VITB6A or VITB6C or VITB6-? <br/>

:::

[^3]: FAO/INFOODS, 2013. https://www.fao.org/infoods/infoods/standards-guidelines/food-component-identifiers-tagnames/en/ 

::: notes
We focused on the 10 fish-relevant food components for inclusion + 21 food components.
For the future, a way of keeping that information should be found (e.g, how can we record and account for those low quality values within the dataset?, can we generate a score with the number of "low quality" values per food item?).
:::

## Step 3: Data cleaning and standardisation of FCTs 

<br/> 

-   Food (fish) name/ description standardisation:

    - [ASFIS* List of Species for Fishery Statistics Purposes](https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/collection/asfis/en)

    - [95 ICS SUA Fisheries codes & categories]()

::: {.fragment}
[*Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Information System]{style="font-size: 20px; color:#696969"}
:::


## Step 3: Food name/ description standardisation 

<br/> 

Fisheries categories matching in Norwegian FCT (2021).

-   **Scientific names** were used to allocate the 'International Standard Statistical Classification for Aquatic Animals and Plants' (ISSCAAP) codes. <br/> 

-   **ISSCAAP codes and text pattern** (food description) to allocate ICS SUA Fisheries codes.<br/> 

-   Review and final allocation of unidentified fish items were performed.

::: notes
For example, fish description mentioning "cured, smoked, salted or dried" were allocated to the fish preparation type "cured" Therefore, a fish entry that was matched to the ISSCAAP code == "39" and to the fish preparation type "cured" would be assigned to the ICS SUA category "1544", which corresponds to "Marine fish, other, cured".
:::

## Step 4a: Data harmonisation and compilation of FCTs 

<br/>

-   **Character values standardisation.** For example, trace ("tr") or below detection limit ("\<LOD") to zero (0) or removing special characters ("\[\]", "()", "\*").<br/> 

-   **Unit of measure standardisation.** For example from mg/100g to g/100g.[^4]<br/> 

-   **Harmonising Food Composition Tables and Databases.** From 12 individual FCTs to a compiled FCT data library.  

[^4]: FAO/INFOODS, 2012. Guidelines for Converting Units, Denominators and Expressions Version 1.0

::: notes
The data library used for the Fisheries Global NCT.
The steps outlined thus far were performed by individual script for each FCT, and were performed not only for fisheries but for the whole FCT. This is important as the burden of compilation of any other commodity from those data sources would be significantly decreased. As, we would see later in the presentation.

:::


## Step 4b: Variable recalculation and missing values 

<br/>

Other data transformation were performed in the harmonised data library. 

- **Re-calculation of food components.** For example, Energy, Carbohydrates by difference or Vitamin A (RAE).

- **Back-calculation from other components.** For example, Niacin, preformed was back-calculated from Niacin, equivalents and Tryptophan. 

- **Combining food components.** For example, Vitamin B6 included: Vitamin B6 determined by analysis, determined by calculation and by unknown method.

- **Data imputation**: For example, if a ICS SUA fishery category did not provided data for one nutrient. 

::: notes
Food components were recalculated using functions generated based on FAO/ INFOODS equations standards. For example, Energy, Carbohydrates by difference or Vitamin A (RAE).
-Food components with different definitions were combined to increase availability of the data. For example: Total fats, dietary fibre, thiamine, and Vitamin B6.
-Food components were back-calculated using adaptation of standard equations. For example, Ash, B-Carotene eq., Retinol, or Niacin.

```

::: notes
In our FCT data library the following variables were recombined: FAT_g\_standardised, FIBTGg_standardised*, THIAmg_standardised and VITB6_mg_standardised
:::

:::

## Step 5: Visual and statistical quality checks 
 
 <br/> 
Visualisation was performed in the harmonised data library for nutrient evaluation and missing values identification. <br/>
<br/> 
Including:

-   **Identification of data gaps & errors.** Systematically non-reported fishery products and/or food components. <br/>
-   **Identification of missing values.** For example, fishery products and food components were reported but high number of missing values were found.<br/>
-   **Outliers.** Values were extremely low or high compared within the same ICS SUA fishery category.

::: notes
We checked the number of missing values per food component using data
visualisation packages. We used the *package naniar*(@ref-naniar) for visualising missing
values by ICS SUA fishery category and by FCT. This allowed us to
identify any typos or mistakes when renaming the food components, and
also to identify potential food components that could be excluded due to
the high number of missing values
Similarly, we used visuals to identify data gaps and completeness for final inclusion of nutrients. 
Histograms and boxplots were used to check the data variability and identify outliers. 
:::

## Step 6: Data formatting & exporting
<br/>

-   Food component values were calculated for each ICS SUA fishery category.

-   Mean or re-calculation of food components were computed & evaluated.

-   Fishery data library was exported to excel.

::: aside
Formatting and re-calculation were done using functions.

## Harmonisation of the data 

<br/>

- **Tagname** re-naming was needed in all FCTs,

    - 4 FCTs did not report Tagnames [(DK19, NZ18, BA13 & NO21)]{style="font-size: 20px; color:#696969"}
  
- **“Lower quality values”** were reported in 4 FCTs [(JA15, KE18, WA19 & UF16)]{style="font-size: 20px; color:#696969"}.

- **Trace and/or below limit of detection values** were transformed to zero in 6 FCTs [(IN17 ("\<LOD"), BA13, BR11, JA15 ("Tr"), KE18 & WA19 ("tr"))]{style="font-size: 20px; color:#696969"}.

- **Measurement units transformation** was needed for Tryptophan,Vitamin A, DHA and EPA in 3 FCTs [(US19, IN17 & JA15)]{style="font-size: 20px; color:#696969"}.

  
## Fisheries categories matching in Norwegian FCT (2021) 

- **ISSCAAP code** was allocated to 79% (183/232) of the fish items in NO21, of which

  -   89% (n=164) of the matches which were using the scientific names 
  -   10% (n=19) were done manually using scientific name/ food description. 

- **95 ICS SUA fishery categories** were matched to 234* fish and fishery products for use in the NCT.

## Transformation & Harmonisation

- 7 food components (SOP, Energy (kcal, kJ), Carbohydrates by difference, Vitamin A (RAE, RE) and Beta-Carotene Eq.) were re-calculated.

- 4 food components (Ash, Beta-Carotene Eq., Retinol, and Niacin) were back-calculated.

- 3 nutrients each (Fat, Thiamine and Vitamin B6) had multiple variables which were integrated.

 clarify these are fatty acids in the title for the stats division who don't know - make the point that this gap is why NO16 was added. 
DHA & EPA were reported to a lesser extent than fat.
This may lead to inconsistencies/ inaccuracies in the final data.
Imputation was discouraged due to lack of accurate data for the missing values and variability of this nutrients in fish.

::: notes
The documentation of these changes are important as they would have an impact of the final estimates, particularly as this variable is used to calculate SOP, and more importantly the total energy. If total energy is calculated using negative values it would lead to a underestimation of the total energy supplied by the foods
:::

## Documentation 

- A document with all the decisions and assumptions was generated.

- In the NCT, `comments` were added as a separated column with all the data transformations: imputation, assumed zero, calculated, etc. 

- Scripts are provided to fully reproduce the approach and/or to update if needed.

::: notes
this is important to 1) identify data gaps, and 2) flagging potential issues with the data.

# The advantages of a scripted approach

Thomas Codd


## The advantages of a scripted approach

-  Changes to the data are recorded in the script, not just in the data itself
-  Repeatable results (given the same input data and scripts have been run)
-  Easy to reapply processes after new data is integrated to the dataset
-  Produces a framework to solve a problem or produce a certain output, which can then be modified

## How a scripted approach allows for fast updates (1)

An update can come in a number of forms:

-  Type 1: The data itself is updated, but the data format and structure remains the same
-  Type 2: The data is updated and the dataset is expanded (e.g. new columns added)
-  Type 3: The data is updated and/or expanded, <b>and</b> the data format or structure is altered

## How a scripted approach allows for fast updates (2)

-  Type 1 solution: No change
-  Type 2 solution: Modify input script to account for new fields (renaming and reformatting etc)
-  Type 3 solution: Recreate input script to account for new data format

## How a scripted approach allows for fast updates - the function aspect

-  Code segments of similar function can be repurposed for specific use-cases
-  Code segments can be written with express intent to complete a function with the least amount of adaptation required - functions
-  Several functions were written throughout this project, and tens of thousands of line of adaptable code


## How a scripted approach allows for re-use of the FCT for new purposes through data interoperability

-  Once an FCT has been processed into an interoperable format the data can be re-used very easily, in R and out 
-  Within R interoperable datasets can be combined with each other, subsetted, analysed, or adapted for other projects very easily
-  Exporting data to a csv and .xlsx document for use in other software is also easy to do

# Conclusion & Recommendations for the future

## What has been completed? 

<br>

- Expanded & updated the Fisheries Global NCT:
 
  -  21 + 6 additional food components for 95 ICS SUA Fisheries Categories.
  -  Additional components were compiled but not reported.
  -  12 FCTs harmonised into a FCT data library.
 <br>

- A framework to reproduce and update FCTs and NCTs:

  -  Re-usable scripts and functions.
  -  Reproducible workflow & report.


## An opportunity

 <br>
 
- For 12 FCTs all data was imported & harmonised in R(Studio).
- The scripts from this project could be re-used to create NCTs for other foods.

 <br>

- "Easily" expanding with new FCTs into the NCT.

:::

## What needs to be further advanced?

 <br>

- Assessment of the impact of the assumptions on the final results (including imputation, calculation, assumed zero, and edible portion).

- Improving the metadata of the FCTs and NCTs. 

- Better reporting of the food composition data.

   - Including methods of analysis, sampling and locations.
   - Avoiding ambiguous and non-standard reporting.
   - Transparent provenance of re-used data.
 
 <br>

- More analytical data prioritised for key foods and nutrients.


::: notes
We checked imputing vs no imputing for this dataset for Retinol & Beta-Carotene Eq., and after consideration we believe that there was no added value. But the report would be available and it would be great to discuss the results.
- Trace/<LOD values into zero
- "Assumed zero" values
- Using back-calculation techniques
- Imputation of values 
:::


## Better data for Nutrition

 <br/>
 
- More **food composition analysis** are required, particularly for some fishery categories & nutrients.
    -  "Aquatic Animals nei", and fish oils in general.
    -  DHA, EPA & Selenium.
     
- High variability in certain nutrient concentration paired with high uncertainty.

  - Low number of values and highly variable.
  - Low or uncertain data quality.
  - Broad spectrum of fish and fishery products within one ICS SUA Fishery Category.

 

::: notes 

For some fishery categories and food components, the number of data were far fewer than for other.

Some of those fishery category with low number of values were very variable, and hard to know if this is the true range of chemical variability or analytical differences.

For example, rethinking some groups. For example, "Aquatic animals, nei".

## Improving data quality & reporting

<br>

1.  Imputation techniques and their overall impact on mean values should be evaluated.

2. Food component description and combination of different methods of analysis (i.e., used for Vitamin B6).

2.  Other data management practices and their impact on final results (i.e., using "low quality values", assuming zero for trace values, data recycling, etc.).  

3.  FCT documentation for reproducibility, transparency and efficiency (i.e., minimum information standards, metadata, ontologies).

::: notes

2. Eg., Is it still relevant the use of three Tagnames if we are combining the results? What does it happen when there is an average of multiple values from different methods of analysis? Wouldn't it be better other reporting system. Eg., providing adequate metadata (both in content and in format) that allow users and machines to identify the method used for each value.

2.e.g, how can we record and account for those low quality values within the
datasets/ FCTs? can we generate a score with the number of "low quality"
values per food item?

3. Open & public dataset, even if the published FCTs doesn't provide full data, but it should be a requirement to make the background data available. Also, improving ontologies and standard vocabulary, and encouraging people to follow them Providing human and machine-readable metadata
